CUDA SciKit
===========

Package Description
-------------------

This SciKit (toolkit for SciPy [1]_) provides Python interfaces to a
subset of the functions in the CUDA, CUDART, CUBLAS, and CUFFT
libraries distributed as part of NVIDIA's CUDA Programming Toolkit
[2]_, as well as interfaces to select functions in the free-of-charge
CULA Toolkit [3]_. In contrast to most existing Python wrappers for
these libraries (many of which only provide a low-level interface to
the actual library functions), this package uses PyCUDA [4]_ to
provide high-level functions comparable to those in the NumPy package
[5]_.
