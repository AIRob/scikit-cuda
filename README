CUDA Python Utilities
=====================

Package Description
-------------------

This package provides Python interfaces to a subset of the functions
in the CUDA, CUDART, CUBLAS, and CUFFT libraries distributed as part
of NVIDIA's CUDA Programming Toolkit [1]_, as well as interfaces to
select functions in the free-of-charge CULA Toolkit [2]_. In contrast
to the various low-level Python wrappers to these libraries that
already exist, this package uses PyCUDA [3]_ to provide high level
functions comparable to those in the NumPy Toolkit [4]_.
