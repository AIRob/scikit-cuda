CUDA SciKit
===========
The CUDA scikit (toolkit for `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_) provides Python 
interfaces to many
of the functions in the CUDA, CUDART, CUBLAS, CUFFT, and CUSOLVER
libraries distributed as part of NVIDIA's `CUDA Programming Toolkit
<http://www.nvidia.com/cuda/>`_, as well as interfaces to select functions in 
the free and
standard versions of the `CULA Dense Toolkit <http://www.culatools.com/dense>`_.  
In contrast to most
existing Python wrappers for these libraries (many of which only
provide a low-level interface to the actual library functions), this
package uses `PyCUDA <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda/>`_ to provide 
high-level functions comparable to
those in `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_.
